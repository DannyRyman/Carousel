# Carousel Test

## Getting starting

```yarn start``` : Runs the application

```yarn test``` : Tests the application

```yarn lint``` : Runs the linter

## Todo and Comments

If I were to spend more time on the carousel, I would improve the following areas:

1. The application was developed on a laptop with a small monitor. On a bigger monitor, the images will become stretched. Given time, I would get the carousel to show more images on a wider viewport.

2. Sometimes the previous and next buttons get misaligned on the larger viewport.

3. Improve the look and feel and styling.

4. Test on different browsers.

5. Increase the test coverage.

6. Fix the warning when running tests.
